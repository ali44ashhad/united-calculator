          Our <strong>Boat Loan Calculator</strong> helps you estimate your
          monthly payments, total interest, and overall loan cost when financing
          a new or used boat. By entering your loan amount, interest rate, and
          loan term, you’ll get a detailed breakdown of how much you’ll pay
          every month and the share of each payment that goes toward principal
          versus interest. This makes it easier to plan your budget, compare
          offers, and avoid surprises later.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What is a Boat Loan?</h2>
          <p>
            A boat loan is a type of financing that allows you to borrow money
            to purchase a boat and repay it in fixed monthly installments over a
            certain period of time. Like other installment loans, each monthly
            payment includes both <strong>principal</strong> (the borrowed
            amount) and
            <strong>interest</strong> (the lender’s charge for borrowing).
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Boat loans are offered by banks, credit unions, marine lenders, and
            even boat dealers. Loan terms can range from as short as 24 months
            up to 240 months (20 years), depending on the lender, your credit
            score, and the type of boat. Generally, larger or more expensive
            boats may qualify for longer loan terms.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">Key terms in a boat loan:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Principal</strong> — The loan amount borrowed after
              subtracting your down payment or trade-in value.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Interest Rate</strong> — The percentage charged annually
              by the lender for borrowing the funds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Loan Term</strong> — The repayment period, usually
              expressed in months or years.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Monthly Payment</strong> — The fixed amount you pay each
              month, which includes both interest and principal.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Boat Loan Formula</h2>
          <p>
            The monthly payment for a boat loan is calculated using the standard
            loan amortization formula, also called the{" "}
            <strong>EMI (Equated Monthly Installment)</strong> formula:
          </p>
          <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-3 rounded-lg overflow-auto mb-3">
            <code>EMI = P × [ r(1 + r)ⁿ ] ÷ [ (1 + r)ⁿ – 1 ]</code>
          </pre>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mb-3">
            <li>
              <strong>P</strong> — Loan amount (principal)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>r</strong> — Monthly interest rate (annual interest rate ÷
              12 ÷ 100)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>n</strong> — Total number of monthly payments
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This formula ensures that your monthly payments remain constant
            throughout the loan term. However, in the early months, a larger
            share of each payment goes toward interest, while later on, more
            goes toward reducing the principal balance.

          <div class="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg space-y-2">
            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> Suppose you buy a boat for{" "}
              <strong>$50,000</strong> and make a down payment of{" "}
              <strong>$10,000</strong>. That means you finance{" "}

              <strong>10 years (120 months)</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Step 1: Monthly interest rate = 6% ÷ 12 = 0.005</p>
            <p>Step 2: Total number of payments = 10 × 12 = 120</p>
            <p>Step 3: Apply formula → EMI ≈ $444.11</p>
            <p>
              Over the loan term, you’ll pay about <strong>$13,293.20</strong>{" "}

            Factors That Affect Boat Loan Payments
          </h2>
          <p>
            Several factors influence your monthly payment and total loan cost.
            Understanding them can save you money:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-5">
            <li>
              <strong>Credit Score:</strong> Higher credit scores usually
              qualify for lower interest rates.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Down Payment:</strong> A larger down payment reduces the
              loan principal and overall interest cost.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Loan Term:</strong> Longer terms mean smaller monthly
              payments but higher total interest.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Type of Boat:</strong> New boats often have better
              financing rates compared to used boats.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Lender Type:</strong> Banks, credit unions, and marine
              lenders may all offer different interest rates and terms.
