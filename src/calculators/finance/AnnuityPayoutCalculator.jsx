            What is an Annuity Payout?
          </h2>
          <p>
            An annuity payout is the periodic payment you receive from an
            annuity investment, typically after retirement. The payouts can be
            fixed or variable, depending on the type of annuity and interest
            assumptions.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">Key terms in an annuity payout:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Principal:</strong> The initial amount invested in the
              annuity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Interest Rate (r):</strong> The periodic rate applied to
              the investment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Number of Periods (n):</strong> Total number of payouts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Payment (PMT):</strong> Amount received per period.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Type of Annuity:</strong> Immediate or deferred payout

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Annuity Payout Formula</h2>
          <p>
            The payout from an annuity is typically calculated using the present
            value formula for an ordinary annuity:
          </p>
          <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-3 rounded-lg overflow-auto mb-3">
            <code>PMT = PV × [ r ÷ (1 – (1 + r)⁻ⁿ) ]</code>
          </pre>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mb-3">
            <li>
              <strong>PMT</strong> — Periodic payment amount
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>PV</strong> — Present value of the annuity (principal)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>r</strong> — Interest rate per period
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>n</strong> — Total number of payout periods
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This formula calculates the fixed payment that will fully deplete
            the investment over the payout term while accounting for interest.

            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> You invest <strong>$100,000</strong> in

              <strong>20 years (240 months)</strong> with a monthly interest

            <li>
              <strong>Investment Amount:</strong> Larger principal results in
