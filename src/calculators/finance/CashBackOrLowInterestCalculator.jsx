            What is a Cash Back or Low Interest Card?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Credit cards typically fall into two categories: rewards cards and
            low interest cards. A <strong>cash back card</strong> gives you a
            percentage of your spending back as rewards, while a
            <strong>low interest card</strong> minimizes finance charges when
            you carry a balance. Choosing between them depends on how you use
            your card: spenders who pay off balances may prefer cash back, while
            those who keep a balance may benefit more from lower interest
            charges.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">Key differences include:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Cash Back Rewards:</strong> Earned as a percentage of
              spending, often 1%–5%.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Low Interest Rates:</strong> Reduce the cost of carrying a
              monthly balance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fees:</strong> Annual fees may apply, so they must be
              factored into savings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Usage:</strong> Best choice depends on whether you spend
              more or carry debt longer.

            Formula Behind the Calculator
          </h2>
          <p>
            The calculator compares annual rewards from cash back with annual
            interest paid on balances. The formulas are:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Cash Back Savings =</strong> (Monthly Spending × Cash Back
              % × 12) – Annual Fees
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Interest Cost =</strong> (Average Balance × Interest Rate)
              – Any Promotional Offers
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-2">
            By comparing the two, the calculator shows which option leaves you
            with more money in your pocket.
